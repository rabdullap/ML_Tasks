How to measure the central tendency is explained and coded in this task we are given house_price.csv which contains property prices in the city of Bangalore. we need to examine price per square feet do the following: Detect the outliers and remove it using: 
1)Mean Function 
2) Percentile method 
3. IQR(Inter quartile range method) 
4.Normal distribution 
5.Zscore method Also, plot the box plot(for all the numerical columns), histplot(to check the normality of the column(price per sqft column)) Check the correlation between all the numerical columns and plot heatmap. Scatter plot between the variables to check the correlation between them.

# ML_Task 2
Q1.Suppose a child psychologist claims that the average time working mothers spend talking to their children is at least 11 minutes per day. You conduct a random sample of 1000 working mothers and find they spend an average of 11.5 minutes per day talking with their children. Assume prior research suggests the population standard deviation is 2.3 minutes. Conduct a test with a level of significance of alpha = 0.05.
Q2. A coffee shop claims that their average wait time for customers is less than 5 minutes. To test this claim, a sample of 40 customers is taken, and their wait times are recorded. The sample mean wait time is found to be 4.6 minutes with a standard deviation of 0.8 minutes. Perform a hypothesis test at a significance level of 0.05 and determine whether there is enough evidence to support the coffee shop's claim.
